Her friends appreciated her effort, and soon, the decorative garden was restored to its former beauty.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, Becky's rock arrangement was a stunning centerpiece, and Dina, surrounded by her friends and loved ones, felt a sense of calm wash over her. As they exchanged their vows, Becky smiled, knowing she had played a small part in making Dina's special day truly unforgettable.", "eval_result": ["80\n\nThe subplot of Tim eating the rocks is quite integrated into the main narrative. His unusual eating habit directly impacts the main plot by reducing the number of rocks Becky has for her decorative garden and for Dina's wedding decor. This causes a problem that Becky must solve, which adds tension and conflict to the story. However, the subplot could be slightly more integrated if Tim's actions had more significant consequences or if his character was more developed.", "90\n\nThe subplot of Dina's wedding is closely integrated with the main narrative of Becky's rock collection. Dina's wedding provides a purpose for Becky's rock collecting, and the subplot of Dina's nervousness about her wedding adds emotional depth to the main plot. The subplot also drives the main plot forward, as Becky's desire to help Dina leads to her replenishing the rock collection. The subplot and the main plot are intertwined and influence each other significantly."]}

Up until the age of 8, he had a complexion that many people envied. However, as time went on, Cody's skin began to peel and flake, causing him immense pain. His parents took him to see multiple doctors, but none could seem to find a solution to his condition.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam, a family friend, loved to fish in the nearby lake. He spent every spare moment by the water, waiting for a bite. One day, Sam spotted the biggest fish he had ever seen. His desire to catch it was overwhelming, and in a moment of reckless abandon, Sam dove into the water after it! The risk paid off, and he emerged victorious, holding the massive fish aloft.\n\nRay, a renowned fashion designer, was at the lake that day, taking inspiration from the natural surroundings for his next collection. As he watched Sam's dramatic fishing attempt, an idea struck him. He approached Cody's parents and offered to design a clothing line specifically for people with skin conditions like Cody's. The clothes would be gentle on the skin and provide comfort to those who needed it most.\n\nRay's innovative response to Cody's condition sparked a new trend in the fashion industry. His designs became popular not only among those with skin conditions but also among people who valued comfort and sustainability. The risk Ray took in pursuing this new direction paid off, and his brand flourished.\n\nAs for Cody, his parents were thrilled to discover that Ray's designs were not the only solution to his skin problems. After consulting with a dermatologist, Cody was prescribed special lotions that would help to soothe and heal his skin. With regular application and care, Cody's skin began to improve, and he was finally able to live a life free from the pain and discomfort that had plagued him for so long.", "eval_result": ["60\n\nThe subplot of Sam's fishing adventure is somewhat integrated into the main narrative. Sam's reckless dive into the lake to catch the fish inspires Ray, a fashion designer, to take a risk and design a clothing line for people with skin conditions like Cody's. However, the subplot is not indispensable to the main storyline. The main narrative could still progress without Sam's subplot, as Cody's skin condition and Ray's response to it are the central focus of the story.", "85\n\nThe subplot of Ray working in the fashion industry and starting a new trend is well integrated into the main narrative. Ray's inspiration for his new clothing line comes directly from witnessing Cody's struggle with his skin condition, making his subplot directly relevant to the main plot. However, it is not completely indispensable as Cody's story could still progress without Ray's subplot, hence the score is not a full 100."]}
