He needed extra money to support himself, but he didn't want to take on a mundane office job. That's when he hit upon the idea of becoming a dog walker. Eugene loved being outdoors and working with animals, so it seemed like the perfect solution.\n\nAround the same time, Lisa was basking in the glory of her recent Olympic gold medal win. She was a phenomenal athlete, and her hard work had paid off. Every day after practice, Lisa would gaze at her medal, reliving the thrill of victory. She was determined to win another one in the next Olympics, and her training regimen was grueling.\n\nAs Eugene started his dog walking business, he began going to people's homes while they were at work. He'd walk their dogs until they were tired, enjoying the fresh air and exercise. One day, he received a call from Lisa, asking him to walk her dog while she was out training. Eugene jumped at the opportunity, not only because it was a lucrative gig but also because he admired Lisa's dedication to her craft.\n\nAs Eugene walked Lisa's dog, he'd often catch glimpses of her training in the nearby park. He was impressed by her focus and determination. Lisa, in turn, appreciated Eugene's love for animals and his ability to tire out her energetic dog. Their interactions were brief but cordial, and Eugene looked forward to their daily encounters.\n\nFor Eugene, walking Lisa's dog was more than just a job – it was a chance to be involved in the life of an Olympic champion. For Lisa, Eugene's services were a necessity, allowing her to focus on her training without worrying about her dog's exercise needs. As they went about their daily routines, Eugene and Lisa's stories converged, highlighting their respective passions and goals. Eugene was content with his outdoor job, and Lisa was determined to win another gold medal. Their paths might have crossed by chance, but their shared enthusiasm for their work created a lasting connection.", "eval_result": ["85\n\nThe subplot of Lisa's Olympic training and aspirations is well integrated into the main narrative of Eugene's dog walking business. Lisa's subplot provides a context for Eugene's job, as he is hired to walk her dog while she trains. Their interactions and mutual admiration add depth to both their characters and create a connection between their individual stories. However, Lisa's subplot could potentially exist without Eugene's story, hence the score is not a full 100."]}

As they wandered through the toy store, Kelsie's eyes landed on a shiny new bike. She begged Tonya to buy it for her, and Tonya agreed, knowing how much her daughter would love it. Kelsie couldn't wait to get home to ride her new bike up and down the street.\n\nAs Tonya was ready to pay for the bike, she realized she was ten dollars short. She rummaged through her purse, but it was clear she didn't have enough cash. Just as she was about to put the bike back, the person in line behind her offered to pay the remaining amount. Tonya was overwhelmed with gratitude and tears pricked at the corners of her eyes.\n\nBack in her bathroom, Mary's fear turned to panic as she hastily got out of the tub, forgetting her modesty in her haste to escape the spider.

She had told all her relatives about it, including her aunt, who had expressed interest in joining them. Lola was thrilled to have her aunt along and was looking forward to a fun-filled weekend.\n\nThe contrast between Joel and Lola couldn't be more striking. While Joel was content to live a frugal life, Lola was eager to spend quality time with her loved ones. However, just as Lola's plans were falling into place, a fight broke out between her and Max.

She had been so looking forward to the beach trip, and now it seemed like it might not happen at all.

It serves as a contrast to Joel's lifestyle and his regrets about not spending money on experiences. However, the subplot could potentially stand on its own and does not directly influence Joel's storyline, hence it is not fully integrated."]}

He decided to eat some cereal before work, pouring himself a bowl and adding milk. However, after taking a bite, he realized it was stale. He was about to discard it, but then thought, \"Tim didn't care.\" He kept eating it, and after it soaked in the milk a bit, it became more palatable.\n\nBack at Becky's house, her friends finally left, and Becky was left staring at the empty spaces in her dad's collection.

Though their lives had intersected briefly, Becky and Tim went about their day, unaware of the small connections they shared.", "eval_result": ["Score: 10\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe subplot of Tim eating his cereal is minimally connected to the main narrative of Becky and her dad's rock collection. The only connection between the two is a vague thematic link of both characters dealing with a minor problem (Becky's guilt over giving away her dad's rocks, Tim's stale cereal) and finding a solution.

He loved playing outside with his friends and exploring the woods near his home. Sam, a family friend, would often take Cody on fishing trips to the nearby lake. Sam loved fishing and would spend hours out on the water, waiting for a bite. Cody enjoyed the quiet time with Sam and the thrill of reeling in a catch.\n\nBut shortly after Cody's 8th birthday, he began to notice his skin itching all the time. At first, it was just a minor annoyance, but as time went on, the itching grew more intense. His skin started to peel and flake, causing Cody a lot of pain. His parents took him to see a doctor, who ordered a series of tests to determine the cause of the skin condition.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam continued to go out onto the lake, hoping to catch the big one. One day, he finally did! He was so excited to reel in the huge fish, but in his moment of triumph, he took his eyes off it for just one second. The fish flopped out of his hands and back into the water, escaping Sam's grasp. Sam was devastated, but he didn't give up. He dove into the lake, determined to catch the fish again.\n\nBack on land, Cody's test results came back, and the doctor diagnosed him with eczema. The doctor prescribed special lotions and creams to help manage the condition, and Cody's skin began to improve.
