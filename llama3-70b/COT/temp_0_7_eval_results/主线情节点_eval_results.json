Bill, seeing an opportunity, offered to help Dalton fix the AC in exchange for a favor - storing a large duffel bag in Dalton's attic for a few days. Dalton, unaware of the contents of the bag, agreed, and Bill breathed a sigh of relief as he hid the stolen money in the attic.\n\nBut Bill's relief was short-lived. The bank's auditors soon discovered the missing funds, and Bill was caught and arrested. The court case was swift and merciless, and Bill was convicted of embezzlement.

But despite their best efforts, they were unable to find a trace of the funds. Bill remained tight-lipped, refusing to reveal the location of the money even when faced with the prospect of additional charges.\n\nIn the end, Bill's fate was sealed. He would spend the rest of his life behind bars, haunted by the knowledge of the money he had stolen and the life he had ruined. And Dalton, who had unwittingly played a role in Bill's scheme, was left to wonder what had become of the mysterious duffel bag he had stored in his attic.", "eval_result": ["90\n\nThe subplot of Dalton's broken air conditioner is closely integrated with the main narrative.

As they played games and ate cake, Eddy's eyes were drawn to the colorful clown that had been hired to entertain the kids. The clown was making balloon animals and telling jokes, but what really caught Eddy's attention were its enormous feet.\n\nEddy couldn't get over how big the clown's feet were. They seemed to be twice as big as his own feet! He wondered how the clown could even fit into shoes that large. As he stared, he noticed that the clown's feet were covering a small puddle of spilled juice that Rose, another party guest, had accidentally knocked over. It covered what Rose needed covering, and Eddy was grateful that the clown had saved the day.\n\nLater, as Eddy and his mom were getting ready to leave, Eddy turned to her and asked, \"Mom, why do clowns have such big feet?\" His mom chuckled and said, \"Well, Eddy, that's a good question.\" Eddy's eyes widened with excitement, expecting a fascinating answer.\n\nBut instead of a magical explanation, his mom simply laughed at his question. Eddy looked up at her, feeling a bit confused. \"Why are you laughing, Mom?\" he asked. His mom smiled and said, \"I'm just amused by your curiosity, sweetie. Now, let me explain something to you.\" She took a deep breath and continued, \"Clowns wear big shoes, Eddy, but they don't have extra big feet. It's just part of their costume to make them look more... clown-like.\" Eddy's eyes lit up with understanding as he nodded, feeling happy to have learned something new.", "eval_result": ["80\n\nThe subplot of Rose spilling juice and the clown covering it up with his large feet is well integrated into the main narrative.

Mike couldn't believe his luck and left the store feeling like he had stumbled upon a treasure trove.\n\nHowever, as Mike walked home, he began to feel a growing sense of nervousness. He had never tried alcohol before, and the thought of drinking it made him a bit anxious. What if he didn't like it? What if he got sick? Mike's mind was racing with questions and doubts.\n\nWhen Mike finally got home, he decided to take the plunge and open one of the bottles he had purchased. He poured himself a glass, took a deep breath, and took a sip. The taste was unfamiliar, but Mike was determined to enjoy his birthday. He took another sip, and another, until the room began to spin.\n\nMike had underestimated the potency of the drink, and before he knew it, he was too drunk to stand up straight. He stumbled around his room, trying to find a place to sit down, but everything seemed to be moving in slow motion. Mike's 21st birthday celebration had gotten out of hand, and he could only hope that the hangover wouldn't be too severe in the morning.", "eval_result": ["80\n\nThe subplot of John's coupons making everything in Mike's cart free is quite integrated into the main narrative. It directly influences Mike's actions and decisions, leading him to purchase more alcohol than he might have otherwise, which in turn leads to the main plot point of him getting drunk on his 21st birthday. However, the subplot could be removed without completely disrupting the main narrative, hence it doesn't score a perfect 100."]}

Until he was about 8 years old, his skin was the envy of all his friends. He would often receive compliments from his family members and even strangers on the street.\n\nHowever, shortly after his 8th birthday, Cody's skin began to itch. At first, it was just a slight tingling sensation, but it soon escalated into an unbearable itch that he couldn't scratch enough. His parents were worried and took him to see the Doctor.\n\nBut before they could get to the Doctor's office, a strange incident occurred. Cody's friend Sam was holding a fish he had caught earlier that day, and for a split second, Sam took his eyes off it. In that brief moment, the fish flopped out of Sam's hands and landed on the floor. Although this incident was unrelated to Cody's skin, it was a memorable event that took place around the same time.\n\nCody's visit to the Doctor finally happened, and after a series of tests, the Doctor delivered the diagnosis: Cody had eczema, a skin condition that caused the itching and irritation. The Doctor prescribed special lotions and creams to help soothe and calm Cody's skin.\n\nWith the new treatment, Cody's skin began to improve dramatically. The itching subsided, and his skin slowly returned to its former smooth and healthy state. Cody was relieved and grateful for the Doctor's help. He learned to take care of his skin and use the special lotions regularly, ensuring that his skin would remain healthy and happy for years to come.", "eval_result": ["10\n\nThe subplot involving Sam and the fish is only tangentially related to the main narrative about Cody's skin condition. It serves as a memorable event that occurred around the same time as Cody's diagnosis, but it does not directly influence or contribute to the main plot."]}
