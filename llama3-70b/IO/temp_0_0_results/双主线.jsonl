The special worker was chatting with him, and Jason learned that Chris had finally taken the worker's advice to go outside again.\n\nChris's eyes lit up as he described the experience to Jason. \"I was amazed at how bright it was outside!\" he exclaimed. \"I had forgotten what it was like to feel the sun on my face.\" The worker beamed with pride, and Jason was happy to see his neighbor taking steps towards recovery.\n\nWith the plumber on the way, Jason returned to his own house to wait. As he watched the water being pumped out of his basement, he thought about Chris's progress. He was glad to see his neighbor taking small steps towards overcoming his agoraphobia. Chris had promised his worker that he would try going outside more often, and Jason had no doubt that he would follow through.\n\nAs the day came to a close, Jason reflected on the unexpected turn of events. A leaky pipe had led him to reconnect with his neighbor, and he was grateful for the chance to see Chris's progress firsthand."}
