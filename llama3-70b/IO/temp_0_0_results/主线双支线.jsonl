He had been thinking about getting her a Fitbit, but wasn't sure if it was the right fit. After trying on a few different models, he finally found the one he thought she'd love.\n\nAs Miranda's search for ingredients began to run long, she grew impatient. She had promised Ray she'd be back in time to start cooking, but the lines at the store were longer than expected.

On a whim, she decided to grab it, thinking it would be a fun surprise for Ray.\n\nWhen Miranda finally returned home, she was relieved to find that Shelley and Hopkins had indeed joined Ray for dinner, and the evening was shaping up to be a pleasant one. As they sat down to eat, Ray surprised his mom with the Fitbit, and she was overjoyed.\n\nAfter dinner, Miranda tried on the shirt she had bought, and Ray loved it on her. She enjoyed wearing his things, and he enjoyed seeing her in them.
