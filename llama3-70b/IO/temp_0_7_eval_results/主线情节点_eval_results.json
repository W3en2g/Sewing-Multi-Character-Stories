Brent insisted that he knew he was wrong, but John could sense the frustration and longing in his friend's voice.\n\nFeeling a pang of sympathy, John decided to offer Brent some words of encouragement before heading back to his own crisis. He reminded Brent that everyone makes mistakes, and that maybe this was an opportunity for him to reflect and grow. Brent nodded, looking a bit more hopeful, and John continued on his way.\n\nBack in his room, John faced the daunting task ahead of him. He opened his textbooks, notes, and study guides, and began to cram. Hours flew by as he pored over the material, his mind racing with formulas, dates, and concepts. The night wore on, and John's eyelids grew heavy, but he pushed on, determined to make the most of the time he had.\n\nFinally, the first light of dawn crept into his room, and John closed his books, exhausted. He got a few hours of restless sleep before the alarm blared, signaling that it was time to face the music. At the exam, John's mind was foggy, but he did his best to recall the information he had studied. When the results were posted, John breathed a sigh of relief - he had barely passed. It wasn't ideal, but it was better than failing. As he walked out of the exam hall, he couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, he would start studying a bit earlier next time.", "eval_result": ["40\n\nThe subplot of Brent's relationship troubles with Joanna is somewhat integrated into the main narrative of John's struggle with his midterm exam. It serves as a distraction for John and provides a moment of character development as he offers advice to Brent. However, it doesn't significantly impact the main plot or its resolution, as John's exam performance and subsequent reflection are independent of Brent's situation."]}

Sarah was initially disappointed, but as soon as she saw the little fish swimming around in its tank, she fell in love. She named the fish Cat, which made her mom chuckle.\n\nMeanwhile, the family's neighbor, Katie, had recently lost her own cat and was feeling abandoned without her furry companion. She would often visit Sarah's family and spend hours talking to Sarah about her own cat and how much she missed her.\n\nOne day, Katie mentioned to Sarah's mom that she was thinking of getting a new cat, but she wasn't sure if she was ready for the responsibility again. Sarah's mom had an idea and suggested that Katie consider fostering a cat until she was sure. Katie agreed, and soon a beautiful grey and white cat named Whiskers arrived at Sarah's house.\n\nAs Katie spent more time with Whiskers, she realized that she was ready to adopt another cat after all. But Sarah had grown so attached to Whiskers that Katie decided to give the cat to Sarah as a gift. Sarah was overjoyed and thanked Katie with tears in her eyes. As she hugged Whiskers tightly, she smiled at her mom and said, \"It looks like I got a pet Cat after all!\"", "eval_result": ["85\n\nThe subplot of Katie feeling abandoned after losing her cat is well integrated into the main narrative. Katie's feelings of loss and abandonment not only mirror Sarah's longing for a pet but also directly influence the main plot when Katie decides to foster a cat. This decision eventually leads to Sarah getting a pet cat, which is the main goal of the story. However, the subplot could have been more seamlessly integrated if Katie's feelings were explored in more depth or had a more significant impact on the main plot."]}

In that split second, the fish flopped away, slipping off the hook and back into the water. Sam wanted the fish so badly that Sam dived in after it, plunging into the lake without hesitation. The cool water enveloped Sam as Sam swam deeper, determined to catch the elusive fish.", "eval_result": ["80\n\nThe subplot of Sue's new phone contract and her one-dollar phone is quite integrated into the main narrative. While it initially seems unrelated to Sam's fishing, it becomes a crucial element when Sam gets distracted by Sue's call log on the new phone, leading to the fish escaping. This subplot directly influences the main plot's progression and Sam's actions, making it significantly relevant. However, it doesn't completely drive the main plot, hence the score is not a full 100."]}
