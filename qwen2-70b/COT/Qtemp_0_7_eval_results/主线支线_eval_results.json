Every morning, Gabe would ride his bike to school, and Rose would be waiting at the gates with a smile that could light up even the darkest of days. Their bond was unbreakable, a friendship that stood the test of time.\n\nOne day, however, something strange happened. Rose was much larger than she had been. It was as if she had grown overnight, and not just in height. Her size had increased in all dimensions, causing her to tower over her peers. The kids at school stared in disbelief, and whispers filled the hallways. Gabe, however, remained undeterred. He saw past the physical changes and continued to support his friend.\n\nGabe's concern for Rose didn't go unnoticed by his mother. She could see the worry etched on her son's face and knew something was amiss. Sensing that Gabe needed guidance, she suggested they visit the doctor. Gabe agreed, hoping that the medical expertise could shed light on Rose's sudden transformation.\n\nThe doctor's visit was uneventful, with no clear explanation for Rose's growth spurt. Gabe's mother reassured him that sometimes, such changes were simply a part of life's unpredictable nature. Gabe, with a heavy heart, accepted the answer and vowed to be even more supportive of Rose.\n\nThe winter season arrived, and snow blanketed the town in a serene layer of white. Rose, now much larger than before, felt the cold more intensely. Gabe, aware of her discomfort, invited her to join his family for a dip in their hot tub, hoping to provide some relief. Rose hesitated at first, unsure of how her size would affect the experience.\n\nGabe's encouragement, however, won her over, and she found herself running out through the snow, the cool flakes hitting her skin. Dressed in her favorite blue bikini, Rose took a deep breath and jumped into the hot tub. The warmth enveloped her body, easing her worries away. She looked around at her friends, her second family, and felt a sense of belonging that transcended her physical changes.\n\nAs they laughed and splashed in the water, Gabe realized that size didn't matter. What truly mattered was the love and support they shared. The snow continued to fall gently around them, but inside the hot tub, the warmth of their friendship kept them cozy and content.", "eval_result": ["80\n\nThe subplot of Gabe riding his bike to school and his mother taking him to the doctor is well integrated into the main story. It helps to establish Gabe's daily routine and his close relationship with his mother, which is important for understanding his character and his reactions to Rose's sudden growth. However, it is not completely indispensable to the main plot, as the story could still function without these details."]}

Witnessing John's determination and spirit, Tom reconsiders his fascination with gun culture.\n5. John, despite his poor performance, decides to continue racing, inspiring Tom to find healthier ways to cope with his problems.\n\nStory:\nJohn had never raced cars professionally before, but the allure of speed and adrenaline was too much for him to resist. He spent countless hours preparing for the upcoming race, eager to prove himself on the track. Tom, his best friend since childhood, was by his side, offering support and encouragement. However, Tom had his own agenda. He wanted to buy a gun, a symbol of power and protection in his eyes. The recent surge in violence had left him feeling vulnerable, and he believed that a firearm would give him the security he craved.\n\nThe day of the race arrived, and John's nerves were on edge. The roar of the engines and the cheers of the crowd filled the air, but John's focus was solely on the track. Tom, on the other hand, couldn't help but be distracted by the gun shop he passed on the way to the race. The window display, with its assortment of gleaming weapons, was a constant reminder of his desire for a gun.\n\nAs the race began, John's inexperience quickly became apparent. He struggled to maintain control of his car, and the other racers quickly left him in the dust. Tom watched from the sidelines, his heart pounding in his chest. He couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment, not just for John, but for himself. The realization that a gun wouldn't solve his problems began to sink in.\n\nDespite not coming close to winning, John knew it was a good first step. He had faced his fears and taken a chance, and that was something to be proud of. Tom, on the other hand, was left with a newfound understanding. Witnessing John's determination and spirit made him rethink his fascination with gun culture. He realized that true strength and courage didn't come from the barrel of a gun but from facing one's fears head-on, just like John had done.\n\nJohn's decision to continue racing, despite his poor performance, inspired Tom.

Her parents had decided to relocate for new job opportunities, and Rainer, being a curious 9-year-old, was eager to explore her new surroundings. The first snowfall of the season was a magical event for her, as she marveled at the fluffy white flakes drifting gently from the sky.\n\nAt school, Rainer quickly made friends with Tim, a boy who shared her love for comic books and video games. Tim, however, had a serious peanut allergy, which he had to be cautious about. Rainer, being a good friend, made sure to always check the ingredients of any snacks she shared with him.\n\nOne particularly snowy afternoon, Rainer's mom suggested they venture outside to embrace the winter wonderland. Hand in hand, they trudged through the knee-high snow, marveling at the silent beauty that surrounded them. Rainer's mom, with a twinkle in her eye, suggested they lay down in the snow and make snow angels. Rainer was thrilled at the idea, and together, they flapped their arms and legs, creating perfect angelic shapes in the pristine snow. Rainer thought the snow angels they made were beautiful, a symbol of the love and joy they shared.\n\nMeanwhile, Tim had invited Rainer to try a new restaurant that had just opened in town. Excitedly, they gathered a group of friends to celebrate the first snowfall. The restaurant was cozy, with warm lighting and the scent of delicious food wafting through the air. Tim, being cautious, informed the server of his peanut allergy and was assured that his meal would be prepared safely.\n\nHowever, fate had a different plan. Midway through his meal, Tim's eyes widened, and his face turned pale. He began to struggle for breath, and it quickly became apparent that he was having an allergic reaction.

The book, passed down through generations, held a collection of stories that had been a part of her family's bedtime routine for decades. Emma was confident in her little one's ability to handle the book gently, but she was also well-prepared for any unexpected accidents.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna, Emma's sister and an enthusiast of culinary arts, was in the kitchen, determined to make pasta for dinner.

Emma rushed in to find that her toddler had indeed made a mess, but not in the way she had anticipated. A big blue mark now marred the pristine page of the heirloom book.

Emma breathed a sigh of relief and shared the good news with Anna.\n\nAnna, still feeling defeated by her culinary mishap, was cheered by Emma's success.

Katie loved her sisters, but she couldn't help feeling a little overwhelmed by the sudden change.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeremy, a childhood friend of Katie's, was going through a different kind of change. He had recently moved out of his parents' house and was visiting them to gather some of his childhood things. As he rummaged through his old toys, he stumbled upon a box of playdough. It was dry and hard, a far cry from the soft and pliable playdough of his youth. Jeremy decided to buy some fresh playdough for Katie and her sisters, hoping it would bring them some joy.\n\nWhen Jeremy arrived at Katie's house, he was met with the typical chaos of a household with newborns. Katie was busy helping her mom with the twins, but she managed to steal a moment to chat with Jeremy. He pulled out the fresh playdough, and Katie's eyes lit up with excitement. They spent the afternoon playing together, molding and shaping the playdough into all sorts of creations.\n\nAs the days went by, Katie grew more and more comfortable with her new role as a big sister. Sure, it was hard work, but she was starting to see the rewards. Her baby sisters would smile at her and coo when she held them, and she even managed to get them to laugh on occasion. Katie realized that she was growing up and learning new things every day, and she was starting to love her new family dynamic.\n\nIn the end, Katie's love for her baby sisters only grew stronger.

It was the sound of a pipe bursting in his kitchen, causing a small flood. Panic set in as he realized the extent of the damage.\n\nMeanwhile, Graham was basking in the glory of his success. His product had gained traction, and he was now delivering the first batch to his customers. Jason was among the first to receive the device, eager to see if it would live up to its promise. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for Jason to discover that something was amiss. The device, meant to save water, had a design flaw that led to pressure build-up and, in some cases, pipe bursts. Jason's experience was not an isolated incident.\n\nRealizing the severity of the situation, Jason called a plumber to fix everything. The plumber, a man with years of experience, confirmed Jason's fears. The device was flawed and potentially dangerous. As word of the issue spread, Graham found himself at the center of a storm.

Bobby's mother finds out about the cheese puffs from Julie and punishes Bobby by not allowing him to have dessert that night.\n\nStory:\nBobby couldn't resist the temptation. While his mother was out running errands, he snuck into the pantry and devoured the entire bag of cheese puffs, crumbs and all. He thought he'd gotten away with it, cleaning up his mess and hiding the empty bag behind the cereal boxes.\n\nJulie, Bobby's older sister, was looking for some extra spending money. She had noticed the missing cheese puffs and the crumbs leading to the pantry. Seeing her opportunity, Julie confronted Bobby, threatening to rat him out to their mother unless he gave her his allowance for the week.\n\nBobby, knowing the consequences of being caught, reluctantly agreed. Julie took the money and put her crafting skills to use, creating handmade jewelry and accessories to sell at a local market. By the end of the day, Julie had made $100 in profit, thrilled with her successful venture.\n\nHowever, Bobby's luck didn't last. His mother returned home and discovered the empty cheese puff bag and the mess Bobby had left behind. Julie, feeling guilty for blackmailing her brother, confessed to their mother about the deal they had made.\n\nBobby's mother was disappointed in both of them but decided to punish Bobby by not allowing him to have dessert that night. Bobby learned his lesson about sneaking snacks and the importance of honesty, while Julie realized that money shouldn't come at the expense of family.", "eval_result": ["90\n\nThe subplot of Julie looking for extra spending money and making $100 is closely integrated with the main narrative. Julie's need for money leads her to blackmail Bobby, which directly influences the main plot of Bobby eating the cheese puffs and getting caught. The subplot also provides a motivation for Julie's actions and adds depth to her character. However, it is not entirely indispensable as the main plot could still proceed without it, hence the score is not a full 100."]}

Concerned about the toll it was taking on him, Tom decided to seek help and visited a psychologist.\n\nMeanwhile, in a classroom across town, Kelly found herself drawn to the boy who sat next to her in class. His name was Jake, and his smile had a way of lighting up the room. Kelly admired him from afar, her heart fluttering every time their eyes met. She found herself daydreaming about the possibility of them being together, a thought that both thrilled and terrified her.\n\nTom's sessions with the psychologist were eye-opening. He learned that his excessive hand washing was a symptom of an underlying anxiety disorder. With the psychologist's guidance, Tom began to understand the triggers behind his behavior and learned coping mechanisms to deal with his anxiety in healthier ways. Slowly but surely, the number of times he washed his hands decreased, and he felt a newfound sense of control over his life.\n\nAs Tom was making progress, Kelly mustered the courage to speak to Jake. They started with small talk, sharing notes and discussing class projects. Over time, their conversations grew deeper, revealing shared interests and a connection that went beyond the classroom. Jake, too, found himself captivated by Kelly's intelligence and warm personality. Before they knew it, they were spending more time together, and their friendship blossomed into something more.\n\nOne day, Jake asked Kelly to be his girlfriend. Overjoyed, Kelly said yes, and they began dating. They were both happy, enjoying the simple joys of young love. Their classmates noticed the change in them, a glow that seemed to follow them wherever they went.\n\nTom, too, was experiencing a change. With the psychologist's help, he no longer felt the need to wash his hands excessively. The relief was profound, and he felt a weight lifted off his shoulders. He was able to focus on other aspects of his life, including his studies and his relationships with friends and family.\n\nIn the end, both Tom and Kelly found their own paths to happiness. Tom discovered the importance of mental health and learned to manage his anxiety, while Kelly found love in the most unexpected place. Their stories, though different in nature, shared a common thread: the power of seeking help and the courage to face one's fears.", "eval_result": ["30\n\nThe subplot of Kelly and her relationship with the boy in her class is not closely integrated with the main narrative of Tom and his struggle with excessive hand washing. While both stories share a theme of overcoming personal challenges, they do not intersect or influence each other in any significant way. The subplot could be removed without affecting the main narrative, indicating a low degree of integration."]}

Disappointed, he had no choice but to settle for either chocolate or vanilla. As he pondered his decision, Dawn and Joyce were enjoying a peaceful walk in the park, unaware that their day was about to take an unexpected turn.\n\nThe sky suddenly darkened, and a heavy rain shower caught Dawn and Joyce off guard.

He was nervous but excited to enter it in the annual art fair, hoping to gain recognition and sell his work. As he set up his display, he noticed a crowd beginning to form. They were drawn to the vibrant colors and emotional depth of his piece. Suddenly, a wealthy buyer approached him, offering to purchase the artwork for $10,000. Mark was stunned and overjoyed, realizing that his dream was finally coming true.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly, Mark's adventurous sister, was having a blast at the nearby park. She had brought her sled and was determined to conquer the tallest snow-covered hill. With a deep breath, she climbed to the top and launched herself down the slope, laughing all the way to the bottom. Her joy was infectious, and soon a group of onlookers had gathered to watch her antics.\n\nAs Kelly sled down the hill for the umpteenth time, her laughter carried over to the art fair. The crowd there turned to see what was causing such merriment and saw Kelly, still laughing, as she reached the bottom of the hill. Mark, who had just sold his artwork for $10,000, spotted his sister and rushed over to share the good news. Kelly was thrilled for her brother, her excitement only adding to the celebratory atmosphere of the day. It was a day filled with joy, success, and the magic of winter.", "eval_result": ["70\n\nThe subplot of Kelly sledding down the hill is moderately integrated into the main narrative. While it doesn't directly influence Mark's success at the art fair, it does contribute to the overall atmosphere of joy and celebration in the story. Kelly's laughter and joy attract attention and add to the festive mood, indirectly enhancing the main plot."]}

Eugene's business quickly took off, as his clients appreciated his dedication and love for their pets.\n\nLisa, Eugene's friend and a phenomenal athlete, was determined to win another championship.

Mary's frantic escape from the spider, naked, leads to an unexpected reunion with Tonya.\n\nStory:\nMary, exhausted from her demanding job, decided to take a bath to unwind. She filled the tub with warm water and a generous amount of bubble bath. As she submerged herself into the soothing water, she felt her muscles relax and the day's stress begin to fade away. She reached for the shampoo, ready to cleanse her hair, when she noticed a spider crawling on the bathroom wall.

They were at the toy store, looking for the perfect birthday gift. Kelsie had her heart set on a shiny red bike, but Tonya wasn't sure if she could afford it.

Lola, his sister, will be planning a beach trip with her husband, but will feel bad that Joel can't enjoy life.

He was stingy with his money, a trait that had earned him a considerable fortune, but also a reputation among his family and friends (Plot Point 1). His sister, Lola, had always been the opposite, cherishing the moments of joy that life had to offer. She was planning a beach trip with her husband, looking forward to the sun, sand, and sea (Plot Point 2). \n\nJoel, on the other hand, had never taken a vacation in his life, nor did he ever buy things for himself. His life was all about saving and accumulating wealth (Plot Point 3). Lola, knowing Joel's habits, felt a pang of sadness for her brother.

It serves as a contrast to Joel's lifestyle and provides a catalyst for his eventual realization and transformation. The subplot is not just a side story, but a crucial element that drives the main plot forward. However, it is not entirely indispensable as Joel's transformation could potentially be triggered by other events or realizations, hence the score is not a full 100."]}
