Mark, inspired by Kelly's unbridled joy, realized that his art should not only be admired but also shared and cherished by others. This epiphany led him to make a bold decision.\n\nAt the art fair, a wealthy collector approached Mark, expressing a deep admiration for his displayed piece. Sensing an opportunity, Mark decided to sell it to the collector. The two negotiated, and in a surprising turn of events, Mark made $10,000 on the one piece! Overwhelmed with gratitude, Mark knew this was the sign he needed to fully commit to his art career. He used the money to invest in better materials, a larger studio, and even began planning his first solo exhibition. Mark's life had taken an unexpected but exciting turn, all thanks to the art fair, Kelly's sled ride, and a chance encounter with a collector.", "eval_result": ["85\n\nThe subplot of Kelly's sled ride is quite well integrated into the main narrative. It serves as a catalyst for Mark's realization about the purpose of his art, which in turn influences his decision to sell his artwork to the collector. This decision is a pivotal moment in the main narrative, leading to significant changes in Mark's life and career. However, the subplot could be more deeply woven into the story, perhaps by further exploring the relationship between Mark and Kelly or by making Kelly's sled ride a recurring motif."]}
