Lagertha refused, and instead went outside to play with her friends.\n\nMeanwhile, shortly after Cody's 8th birthday, his skin began to itch. As time went on, his skin began to peel, causing him pain. Lagertha returned home at dusk to find candy and roast lamb to eat, but her mother forbade her to have any and sent her to her room.\n\nCody's condition worsened, and he went to the doctor who ordered tests. The tests showed that Cody had eczema. He was prescribed special lotions, and with time, his skin began to improve.\n\nLagertha, still in her room, could only imagine the delicious food she was missing out on. She vowed to never let her mother tell her what to do again, but also hoped that Cody's skin would continue to heal. Despite their different experiences, Lagertha and Cody remained close friends, supporting each other through life's challenges."}

The screen flickered with images of a family of Syrian refugees, their faces etched with the hardships of their journey. Sally's eyes welled up, and Tommy's jaw clenched. They felt a deep sadness, a shared empathy for the plight of these strangers so far away. \"We have to do something,\" Sally whispered, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nSarah, their older sister, loved the winter. She found solace in the quiet stillness that came with the season. One of her favorite things about this time was the trees, their branches heavy with snow, creating a serene landscape that she could gaze at for hours. Sarah was a peaceful person, and the winter, with its snow-covered branches, was a reflection of her inner calm.\n\nDetermined to make a difference, Sally and Tommy decided to have a lemonade stand. They spent the week preparing, mixing gallons of lemonade and baking cookies to sell. Their goal was to raise money for the Syrian refugees they had seen on TV. On Saturday, they set up their stand on the corner of their street, a bright spot amidst the quiet neighborhood.\n\nSarah, who usually spent her days staring out the window, watching the snow pile on the branches, found herself drawn to the energy of her siblings' endeavor. She admired their determination and the way they worked tirelessly, their faces flushed from the sun and the excitement of their mission. Sally and Tommy sold lemonade all day Saturday, their voices hoarse from calling out to passersby, their spirits undeterred by the occasional rejection.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Sally and Tommy counted their earnings. They had raised fifty-two dollars, a small fortune to them. Their hearts swelled with pride and joy. They felt glad, knowing that their efforts could make a difference, no matter how small. Sarah, who had watched them from the window all day, felt a deep sense of pride. She realized that her peaceful nature was not just a product of the winter landscape but also a result of the love and compassion she saw in her siblings.\n\nIn the end, Sally, Tommy, and Sarah learned that even in the midst of winter, when the world seemed quiet and still, there was always a way to make a difference. Their actions, though small, had brought warmth to their hearts and hope to those in need. And Sarah, with her love for the winter and her peaceful nature, knew that the world was a better place because of her siblings' kindness."}
