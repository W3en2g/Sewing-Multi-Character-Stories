When he emerged from the testing room, he was relieved to see that he had passed - barely. \n\nJoe, on the other hand, was having a much more pleasant day. He and his coworkers were trying out a new restaurant for lunch, and he had high hopes for the place. As they sat down to order, Joe scanned the menu eagerly. He ordered a sandwich and waited eagerly for it to arrive. \n\nBut as the group chatted and laughed, their conversation was interrupted by a commotion outside. Suddenly, the door burst open and a group of police officers rushed in. Joe's heart sank as he saw Doug being dragged in, his face bruised and bloodied. He had gotten into a fight with his son, and the police had been called to intervene. \n\nJoe felt sick as he watched Doug being handcuffed and dragged out of the restaurant. His appetite was gone, and he couldn't stop thinking about the violence he had witnessed. He knew he wouldn't be coming back to this restaurant anytime soon."}

The feel of the sand between her toes, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore, and the warmth of the sun on her skin all made her feel alive. So when her family planned a weekend getaway to the coast, Nellie was excited. She spent hours playing in the water, building sandcastles, and soaking up the sun.\n\nOne afternoon, Nellie decided to take a nap on the beach. She lay down on her towel and closed her eyes, breathing in the salty sea air. She drifted off to sleep, lulled by the sound of the waves.\n\nWhen Nellie woke up, she panicked. She couldn't move! She tried to sit up, but her arms and legs were trapped in the sand. She called out for help, but her family was nowhere in sight. Nellie's little brother had buried her in sand while she slept!\n\nMeanwhile, a group of kids was playing basketball on the court nearby. Charles was playing too, even though he was about twenty years older than the rest of them. He pretended to be nervous as he took his shot, but then he sunk it flawlessly. The kids cheered, impressed by his skills.\n\nBut while Charles was playing basketball and Nellie was trapped in the sand, Sadie was at her high school prom with her boyfriend. She was excited to be there, twirling around in her fancy dress and feeling like a princess. She was even nominated for prom queen! But when it came time to accept the crown, Sadie decided to pass. She didn't want the attention or the pressure. Another girl took her spot, and Sadie was relieved.\n\nBack on the beach, Nellie was still stuck. She tried to wiggle her way out, but it was no use. She was starting to feel scared and alone. But just when she thought she was going to be trapped forever, her family returned. They had been out for a walk and hadn't realized what had happened. They quickly dug Nellie out of the sand, and she was free at last.\n\nAs Nellie dusted herself off and hugged her family tightly, Charles and the kids on the court finished their game. They all high-fived and laughed, feeling the rush of adrenaline from the competition. Sadie left her prom feeling relieved and happy, glad to have avoided the spotlight. And Nellie? Well, she learned to never fall asleep on the beach again!"}
