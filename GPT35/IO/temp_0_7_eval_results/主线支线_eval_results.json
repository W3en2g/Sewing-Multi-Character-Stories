Lola's disappointment when Joel refuses to go on the trip serves as a catalyst for Joel's realization of his missed opportunities and his decision to change his ways. The subplot is not entirely indispensable, as Joel's regret could have been triggered by other events, but it significantly enriches the main narrative and provides a concrete example of the consequences of Joel's penny-pinching ways."]}

One day, she decided to show off her rock collection. Unfortunately, her collection was lacking and she knew it wouldn't impress anyone. \n\nMeanwhile, Tim woke up early one day and decided to have a bowl of cereal for breakfast. As he poured the milk, he noticed a small rock sitting on the counter. Without thinking, he dropped it into his bowl and continued with his breakfast. \n\nLater that day, Becky's pals came over and begged her to see her rock collection. Becky knew she needed to do something to impress them. She remembered the small rocks Tim had left behind and decided to let her pals each keep one. \n\nAs they examined their new rocks, Tim continued to eat his cereal. He noticed that the rock had soaked in the milk a bit and had become softer. Surprisingly, it tasted good. \n\nThe next day, as Becky walked along the road, she picked up rocks to fill the spaces in her collection. As she looked down, she noticed an unusual rock and picked it up. It was soft and had a strange taste. She took it home to show her pals, but they were unimpressed. \n\nBecky didn't understand why her pals didn't like the rock, but Tim knew exactly why. He had been eating rocks soaked in milk for days and had developed a taste for them. He couldn't believe he had found someone who shared his strange taste.", "eval_result": ["85\n\nThe subplot of Tim eating rocks soaked in milk is quite integrated into the main narrative of Becky trying to impress her friends with her rock collection. Tim's unusual habit of eating rocks soaked in milk not only provides Becky with the rocks she needs to impress her friends, but also serves as a point of connection between the two characters. However, the subplot could exist without the main plot, and vice versa, which prevents a perfect score."]}
