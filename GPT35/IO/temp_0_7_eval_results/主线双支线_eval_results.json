She knew how much it meant to her husband and how hard he had been working. But the finances just didn't add up.\n\nDonna was very relieved at the turnaround her son had made. He had finally realized the importance of education and was working hard to catch up on his studies.\n\nOne day, Joel had an idea. He decided to surprise Lola and her husband with a trip to the beach. It was something he had always wanted to do but never had the chance to. He also decided to help Donna's son by paying for a tutor to help him with his studies.\n\nAs he watched Lola and her husband enjoy the sun and sand, and Donna's son improve his grades, Joel felt happy. He realized that money was meant to be spent, not just saved. And he was glad that he could finally make a difference in the lives of those around him.", "eval_result": ["85\n\nThe subplot of Lola planning a beach vacation with her husband is well integrated into the main narrative. Lola's financial struggles and her inability to realize her plans directly influence Joel's character development and his decision to spend his savings on others. However, Lola's subplot is not the only one affecting Joel's transformation, as Donna's son's situation also plays a significant role. Therefore, while Lola's subplot is important, it is not entirely indispensable to the main storyline.", "80\n\nThe subplot of Donna's son getting into trouble and then making a turnaround is well integrated into the main narrative.

Surprisingly, he kept eating it even after the rocks soaked in the milk a bit.\n\nMeanwhile, Dina was getting married in two weeks, and she was already anxious about the big day. She hoped that she would not be so nervous on the actual day of the wedding. Becky's pals came over for the picnic, and they all had a great time. When they begged Becky to let them keep the rocks she had collected, she obliged, and each of her pals took a rock.\n\nAfter the picnic, Becky walked along the road picking up more rocks to fill the spaces in her rock collection. She was so focused on finding the perfect rocks that she didn't realize she had been walking for hours. Eventually, she found herself lost and started to panic. She noticed a familiar rock on the ground and realized she was walking in circles.\n\nFinally, she found her way back and was relieved to see her pals waiting for her. They all laughed and joked about her getting lost. As they were leaving, Tim mentioned how much he loved the milk-soaked rocks.

It is connected to the main story through the theme of rocks, which is a recurring element in the story.

It does, however, provide a humorous ending to the story.", "20\n\nThe subplot of Dina's upcoming wedding is mentioned twice in the main story, but it doesn't significantly impact the main narrative about Becky's picnic and her rock collection.

He would spend hours on the lake, trying to catch the biggest fish in the water. One day, while he was fishing, he saw a big fish swimming in the water. Sam wanted the fish so badly that he dived in after it! He swam deeper and deeper until he caught the fish. It was a risky move, but it paid off.\n\nRay worked in the fashion industry.

The only connection is the thematic link of taking risks, but Sam's fishing adventure does not directly influence or interact with Cody's story.", "90\n\nThe subplot of Ray working in the fashion industry and starting a new trend based on Cody's skin condition is highly integrated into the main narrative. Ray's actions directly impact Cody's life, leading to a resolution of his skin condition and a newfound acceptance of his uniqueness.

However, it doesn't reach a full score of 100 as the subplot could potentially exist independently, although it would lose significant context and impact."]}
