Eddy couldn't stop staring at the clown's feet, which seemed to be larger than any he had ever seen before.\n\nThe clown had begun to perform, and Eddy was enjoying the show until his attention was drawn back to the clown's enormous feet. He leaned over to his mother and whispered, \"Why are his feet so big?\"\n\nHis mother chuckled and replied, \"They wear big shoes to make them look funny, but they don't actually have extra big feet.\"\n\nEddy felt relieved to know that the clown wasn't some kind of mutant with giant feet. He tried to focus on the performance, but his attention was again diverted when he saw Rose, a shy girl from his class, standing off to the side.

Eddy was relieved to see that Rose was no longer embarrassed. He continued to watch the clown's performance, but now he couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the clown. He was probably uncomfortable with those big shoes.\n\nAs the party came to an end, Eddy said goodbye to his friend and thanked him for inviting him. On the way home, Eddy asked his mother if they could buy the clown some comfortable shoes. His mother laughed at his question and said that it was a nice thought, but they couldn't just give shoes to a stranger. Eddy felt a little disappointed but promised himself that he would always try to help others in need.", "eval_result": ["70\n\nThe subplot of Rose's dress being too short and Eddy's mother helping her is moderately integrated into the main narrative. It serves to highlight Eddy's empathetic nature and his tendency to notice and care about the discomfort of others, which is a theme that also comes up in his concern for the clown's oversized shoes. However, the subplot could be removed without significantly altering the main narrative about Eddy's experience at the birthday party and his reaction to the clown."]}
