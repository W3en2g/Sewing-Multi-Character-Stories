Lagertha's mother forbids her from using any of Cody's lotion, leading to a confrontation.\n\nStory:\nLagertha was a spunky girl who lived life on her own terms. She didn't like being told what to do, especially by her mother. One summer day, her mother forbade her from going out to play with her friends. Lagertha refused and snuck out to play anyway.\n\nAs she was playing, she noticed Cody, a boy from the neighborhood who she had seen around but never really talked to. Lagertha had always thought Cody had really nice skin, but as they were playing, she noticed it was not so nice anymore. She asked him what happened, and he told her he had a skin condition.\n\nCody went on to say that he had been prescribed special lotions that made his skin better. Lagertha was intrigued and asked if she could use some too. Cody agreed and gave her a small sample.\n\nWhen Lagertha went home, she showed her mother the lotion and asked if she could use it. Her mother forbade her from using it, stating that it was not meant for her and that she needed to stay away from Cody and his things.\n\nLagertha didn't like being told what to do and felt that her mother was being unfair. She tried to reason with her, but her mother wouldn't budge. Lagertha was furious and stormed off to her room.\n\nAs she sat in her room, she couldn't help but feel angry and frustrated. She felt like her mother didn't understand her or her needs. She decided to take matters into her own hands and snuck out to see Cody again.\n\nWhen Cody saw her, he was surprised but happy to see her. They talked for a while, and Lagertha expressed her frustration with her mother. Cody sympathized with her and suggested that she talk to her mother again.\n\nFeeling emboldened by Cody's support, Lagertha went home and confronted her mother. She explained how she felt and how she thought her mother was being unfair. To her surprise, her mother listened and they were able to work out a compromise.\n\nLagertha learned that sometimes it's better to talk things out and that rebellion isn't always the answer. She also learned the power of empathy and support from unexpected sources."}

He discovers that his friend Chris, who has been agoraphobic for years, has been trying to fix a leak. Chris promises his worker he will try to leave the house more. Jason calls a plumber to fix everything.\n\nStory:\nJason woke up to the sound of water dripping steadily, almost like a metronome. He frowned and rolled over, trying to ignore it, but it persisted. Finally, he groggily got up and stumbled to the bathroom, thinking that maybe he left the faucet running. But as he washed his hands, he realized the noise was coming from somewhere else.\n\nCuriosity piqued, Jason followed the sound, which led him to the door to the basement. He hesitated for a moment, wondering if he should just go back to bed and deal with it in the morning, but something in the rhythm of the dripping made him uneasy. He opened the door and was immediately hit by the musty smell of old, damp air.\n\nDown the stairs, he could hear someone moving around, and he called out to Chris, his friend who had been agoraphobic for years. There was no response, but the sound of water was louder now, and he could hear something else - the scraping and clanging of tools.\n\nJason made his way down the stairs, his eyes adjusting to the dim light. Chris was hunched over a pipe, his back to Jason. He looked up when he heard footsteps, his expression a mix of surprise and embarrassment.\n\n\"I'm sorry, man,\" Chris said, gesturing to the mess around him. \"I didn't want to bother you, but I thought I could fix this leak myself.\"\n\nJason walked over to him and looked at the pipe. It was old and rusted, and Chris had clearly been struggling with it for a while. But there was something about the way he was working - a sort of dogged determination - that Jason had never seen before.\n\n\"Let me help,\" Jason said, and Chris nodded gratefully.\n\nTogether, they worked on the pipe, and for a while, the only sound was the steady drip of water as it splashed against the concrete floor. But as they worked, Chris started to talk. He told Jason about his worker, who had been encouraging him to try and leave the house more often, to face his fears. He even had a plan for Chris to visit the local grocery store, just for a few minutes at a time.\n\n\"I promised him I'd try it,\" Chris said, his voice low. \"I know I can't keep hiding forever.\"\n\nAs they finished up, Jason thought about what Chris had said. He knew how hard it was for his friend to even leave the house, let alone go to a crowded, public place. But something about the way Chris had been working - with such focus and determination - made Jason think that maybe, just maybe, he could do it.\n\n\"Let's call a plumber,\" Jason said, looking around at the mess. \"We'll get this fixed properly.\"\n\nChris nodded, a small smile on his face, and as they walked back up the stairs, Jason felt a sense of hope - for his friend, and for himself. Maybe, just maybe, things could get better."}

This time, Maggie had turned her life around, and Dan had found his way out of the rut. They both knew that life was full of ups and downs, but they were determined to keep moving forward."}
