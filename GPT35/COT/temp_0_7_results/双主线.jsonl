Everyone was excited to sit down and enjoy the meal. However, Bobby had other plans. He decided to go to a fast food restaurant to get some french fries. \n\nWhen he returned, he sat down and started pouring ketchup on his food. As soon as everyone started eating, Gina's mom became nauseous. She tried to ignore it, thinking it was just a stomach bug, but soon everyone started feeling queasy. \n\nBobby was the first to notice that the ketchup was rancid. He quickly threw it away, hoping that would solve the problem. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. The family continued to feel sick, and Gina's mom was getting worse by the minute. \n\nEventually, Gina decided to throw away the food and order Chinese food instead.

While they waited for the food to arrive, Bobby went up to the counter and asked for some ketchup packets. \n\nThe family was relieved when the Chinese food arrived, and they all started to feel better after eating it. They were grateful that Gina had taken charge and made sure everyone was okay. From that day on, they all made a pact to never take their health for granted, and to always be mindful of what they were eating."}
