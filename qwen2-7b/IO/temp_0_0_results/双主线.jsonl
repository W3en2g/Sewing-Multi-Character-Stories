This evening, Tim had asked the waiter if there were any peanuts in his food, a routine precaution he took every time he dined out. The waiter assured Tim that there were no peanuts in his meal.\n\nHowever, Bryan, who was behind in school due to his persistent refusal to do his homework, was not paying attention to the conversation. He was more focused on playing with his toy car under the table. As a result, he missed the crucial information about the peanut-free nature of his father's meal.\n\nDespite the waiter's assurance, Tim experienced an allergic reaction. The medical costs for his treatment were significant, and Tim decided to take legal action against the restaurant. This decision led to Bryan having to attend a tutor every night to catch up on his schoolwork.
