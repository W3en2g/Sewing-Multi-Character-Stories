Ruffles was an adventurous feline who enjoyed exploring their quiet neighborhood during the day. The city council's plan deeply concerned Lisa, as the increased construction activity posed a serious threat to Ruffles and other pets in the area.\n\nSeeing the potential harm this new measure could inflict on their peaceful community, Rob decided to take action. He organized a petition against the city council's plan, knocking on doors and explaining the situation to his neighbors. Many were supportive and agreed with Rob's concerns, resulting in numerous signatures being collected. His dedication and passion for preserving the tranquility of their neighborhood were infectious, rallying the community together.\n\nOne afternoon, as construction crews began setting up prematurely in a nearby lot, Ruffles, curious as always, wandered towards the commotion. Lisa, noticing her cat's absence, started searching frantically. She spotted Ruffles just in time as he approached the dangerous construction site. Swiftly, she scooped him up, saving him from a potentially harmful situation.\n\nRob, armed with the community's support encapsulated in his petition, presented their collective concerns to the city council. The council, surprised by the strong opposition, reconsidered their plan. Extensive deliberations ensued, and thanks to Rob's diligent efforts, he was able to prevent the measure from being implemented.\n\nThe neighborhood breathed a collective sigh of relief. Lisa, holding Ruffles close, thanked Rob for his efforts.

Ruffles' near-miss with the construction site serves as a tangible example of the potential dangers posed by the city council's plan, adding emotional weight to Rob's campaign against it. Lisa's concern for Ruffles' safety also mirrors the broader community's concerns about the impact of unrestricted construction. The subplot is not entirely indispensable, as the main narrative could technically proceed without it, but it significantly enhances the story's emotional resonance and thematic depth."]}

Her child was due for a regular check-up, an event that was less than exciting for the little one. To keep him calm and occupied, Edna had promised him a new toy after the visit.\n\nAs Tom ventured deeper into the forest, he realized he had underestimated the vast wilderness. The forest was denser, the paths were trickier, and the markers were not as frequent as he had anticipated. Consequently, he lost track of time and direction. Before he knew it, the sun was setting, painting the sky with shades of orange and purple before leaving him in total darkness.\n\nMeanwhile, Edna's visit to the doctor had gone well. Her toddler was healthy and full of energy. The doctor praised Edna for her excellent parenting and handed a toy to the toddler. The child's eyes lit up at the sight of the toy, a new companion to take home. Edna thanked the doctor, a warm smile on her face.\n\nAs Edna and her toddler settled down for the night in the comforting confines of their house, Tom was navigating his way through the darkness. His initial fear gradually gave way to determination. He remembered a lesson from his elementary school days about the North Star guiding lost travelers. Looking up, he spotted the bright Polaris, and with renewed confidence, started following it.\n\nHours passed. Just when Tom was beginning to lose hope, the familiar outline of Willow Creek appeared on the horizon. The North Star had guided him home. Exhausted but triumphant, Tom returned to his house, promising himself to be better prepared for his next adventure.\n\nEven though they had spent their day differently, both Edna and Tom experienced the joy of homecoming that night, albeit in their own unique ways.", "eval_result": ["20\n\nThe subplot of Edna taking her toddler to the doctor is not closely integrated with the main narrative of Tom's hiking adventure.

With nothing to lose, she carefully dabbed at the big blue mark with a damp cloth. To her immense relief, the marker started to fade, and soon enough, it was all gone.

It was his dream to make internet safer for everyone.\n\nBack in Germany, Neil took a train ride to the beautiful yet somewhat eerie location. As the train rolled through the countryside, he looked out at the vast expanse of trees, their dense shadows adding an element of mystery. He thought the forest was spooky, but beautiful nonetheless. He captured stunning photographs, wrote detailed descriptions, and shared the stories of his journey with his followers.\n\nSimultaneously, Graham was receiving overwhelming response for his product. Thousands of people were contributing to support his idea. However, his joy was short-lived. A mega corporation claimed that Graham's product was a plagiarised version of their own, leading to a legal battle. Despite his genuine efforts to prove his innocence, Graham lost all his money in the lawsuit. He was devastated, his dream shattered.\n\nAround this time, Neil, who had returned from Germany, stumbled upon the news of Graham's predicament. Intriguingly, he recognised Graham as the man he had briefly met on his train ride to the forest. Graham had shared his product idea with Neil, who found it quite innovative. Neil, having a soft spot for underdogs and a strong online presence, decided to use his influence to help Graham. He shared Graham's story with his followers, asking them to support the unjustly treated entrepreneur.\n\nThe response was overwhelming. Neil's followers poured in their support, financially and morally, for Graham. With the funds raised, Graham was able to pay off his debts and revive his project. Thus, the end of Neil's visit to Germany marked a new beginning for Graham, all thanks to a spooky but beautiful forest and a coincidental train ride.", "eval_result": ["90\n\nThe subplot of Graham's product idea, crowdfunding, and subsequent lawsuit is closely integrated with the main narrative of Neil's travel blogging and visit to Germany. The subplot and main plot intersect when Neil and Graham meet on the train, and Neil's actions following his return from Germany directly influence the resolution of Graham's subplot. The subplot is not entirely indispensable to the main storyline, as Neil's travel blogging could exist without it, but it significantly enriches the narrative and provides a meaningful conclusion."]}

His heart pounded in his chest, a mix of guilt and thrill coursing through his veins.\n\nBack at home, Kim slathered the gloss on and rubbed her lips together. Almost immediately, her lips began to itch and swell. With a sense of dread, she realized she was having an allergic reaction. She was allergic to the gloss!\n\nMeanwhile, Bill's illicit activities had finally caught up with him. The authorities had been alerted to inconsistencies in the bank's accounts. As they began their investigation, they found evidence of Bill's involvement. However, when they searched for the stolen money, they came up empty-handed. The authorities never found Bill's money.\n\nWhile Kim was dealing with her allergic reaction, she discovered a stash of cash hidden in one of her makeup drawers. It was the gloss that had led her to it. The same gloss that she was allergic to was the only reason she had found the stolen money. As she pieced together the puzzle, she couldn't help but feel a sense of ironic gratitude towards the gloss. In the end, it was her allergy that helped uncover Bill's secret.", "eval_result": ["90\n\nThe subplot of Bill's embezzlement and the authorities' inability to find the stolen money is closely intertwined with the main story of Kim's allergic reaction to her lip gloss. The subplot is not only referenced in the main story, but it also directly impacts the main plot, as Kim's allergic reaction leads her to discover the stolen money. The subplot and the main story are therefore highly integrated, with the subplot being almost indispensable to the main storyline."]}

While her peers, including Sadie, were at their high school prom, she was on her way to her aunt's place. She knew that she was missing out, but she had a responsibility, and she intended to fulfill it.\n\nSimultaneously, Sadie, dressed in a shimmering gown, was at the prom with her boyfriend. The magical night was as enchanting as she had imagined. As the prom queen from the previous year, she was anticipated to pass on her crown to the next queen.\n\nMeanwhile, Lori, who was a bit annoyed about missing the prom and in a hurry to get to her aunt's house, was parking her car. In her haste, she misjudged the distance and crashed into the garage door. The impact was substantial, causing a lot of damage to both the car and her aunt's property.\n\nBack at the prom, Sadie had made a surprising decision. After much contemplation, she decided to pass on the crown. She felt the other girl, who had worked equally hard, deserved a chance to bask in the glory. The crowd was shocked but cheered for the new queen, while Sadie smiled, content with her decision.\n\nAt the same time, Lori was assessing the wreckage. The front bumper of her car was crushed, the headlights shattered, and the garage door was severely dented. The damages were extensive, and she knew she had to take responsibility for her actions.\n\nIn one night, both girls had made choices that would significantly impact their lives. While Sadie’s decision had led to shared joy and respect, Lori’s misjudgment had resulted in a bitter lesson about responsibility.", "eval_result": ["60\n\nThe subplot of Sadie deciding to pass on her crown at the prom is moderately integrated into the main narrative. While it doesn't directly influence Lori's storyline, it serves as a thematic parallel. Both girls are making significant decisions on the same night, with Sadie's decision reflecting a positive outcome and Lori's resulting in a negative one. This subplot adds depth to the overall narrative by providing a contrasting perspective on the theme of responsibility and decision-making."]}

Mark, a struggling artist, was meticulously setting up his booth. His masterpiece, a stunning landscape painting, was the culmination of months of hard work and creativity. Simultaneously, just a stone's throw away, the park was covered in a blanket of fresh snow. \n\nKelly, a lively young girl, was captivated by the sight of the untouched snow-covered hill in the park. She quickly fetched her sled and climbed to the top of the hill, her heart pounding with excitement. Her laughter echoed through the park as she pushed off, sliding down the hill in a whirl of snowflakes.\n\nHer gleeful laughter and the sight of her flying down the hill caught the attention of passersby. One by one, they stopped to watch her fearless descent, their laughter joining hers. The crowd grew larger, with people gathering around the hill's base, near Mark's booth.\n\nThe crowd's curiosity was piqued by the stunning landscape painting displayed in Mark's booth. As Kelly made her final descent, the crowd applauded her fearlessness and then turned their attention to Mark's artwork. It was a captivating sight, a vivid depiction of the very park they were standing in, painted with such skill that it seemed to come alive.\n\nPeople were so impressed by his work that they began bidding for it. The price quickly escalated, and before Mark knew it, he had sold his masterpiece for a staggering $10,000! He was stunned and elated. He had never made that much on one piece before.\n\nKelly, finished with her sledding, joined the crowd around Mark's booth, laughing and clapping for the artist's success. Mark thanked her for unknowingly attracting the crowd, and they both celebrated each other's victories that cold, snowy day. Thus, a simple day at the park and the art fair turned out to be a memorable one for both Mark and Kelly.", "eval_result": ["90\n\nThe subplot of Kelly sledding down the hill is closely integrated with the main story of Mark's art fair. Kelly's sledding attracts a crowd to the park, which in turn brings attention to Mark's artwork. This leads to the successful sale of his painting.

Lisa was a phenomenal athlete, having won several national championships. However, she was not content with her past victories. She was determined to win another one, and was dedicating every waking hour towards achieving her goal.\n\nAs Lisa's training schedule intensified, she found it increasingly difficult to take care of her beloved pet dog, Max. She needed help, someone she could trust to take care of Max while she was away at her training sessions.\n\nMeanwhile, Eugene had come up with a novel idea to earn the extra money he needed.
