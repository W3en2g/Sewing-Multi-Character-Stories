Recently, he was upset about a measure the city council was pushing forward. They were planning to construct a large commercial complex in the town's cherished park. As a lover of nature and open spaces, Rob was vehemently against the idea.\n\nHis friend Lisa was also concerned about this. She had a house cat, Ruffles, who loved to frolic in the park. She feared that the construction would rob Ruffles of his favorite playground. Meanwhile, their friend Mark, an artist, was too engrossed in his work for the upcoming art fair to share their concerns.\n\nUndeterred, Rob decided to take action against the city council's measure. He organized a petition, going door-to-door and explaining the issue to his neighbors. He rallied the townsfolk, pointing out the value of preserving the park for future generations, and collected numerous signatures.\n\nOne afternoon, while Rob was out collecting signatures, Lisa's Ruffles dashed out into the park. Startled by a loud construction noise, he climbed up a tall tree and couldn't get down. Lisa was terrified but managed to catch Ruffles just in time, saving him from the precarious situation.\n\nMeanwhile, at the art fair, Mark was enjoying a wave of success. His masterpiece, a beautiful oil painting of the threatened park, captivated the attendees. The bidding war for his work was fierce, and he ended up making a whopping $10,000 on the one piece!\n\nThe next week, Rob presented the petition to the city council. The overwhelming number of signatures and Mark's artwork, which was now famous town-wide, made the council reconsider their decision.

One day, she found a peculiar way to do it. She walked along the sun-dappled road, picking up shiny, rounded rocks to fill the empty spaces in her patchwork bag. She had always been fascinated by geology and thought this was a perfect way to share her interest.\n\nMeanwhile, down the lane, Tim's alarm clock buzzed unusually early. He was not a morning person, but he had found solace in his new routine. His day would begin with a bowl of cereal, soaked in cold milk until it reached the perfect consistency. He savored each spoonful, the crunchy flakes softening just enough to please his palate.\n\nIn the midst of these serene moments, excitement buzzed in the air. Dina, the town's sweetheart, was getting married in two weeks. Her house was a flurry of activity, with decorators, caterers, and family members bustling around. Despite the chaos, Dina was often found sitting quietly in her room, her mind filled with wedding jitters. She hoped that she wouldn't be so nervous on the actual day of the wedding.\n\nBack on the road, Becky's pals had been following her keenly, intrigued by her rock collection. Their curiosity piqued, they begged Becky to share her treasures. Touched by their interest, Becky let each of them keep a rock, adding a touch of her charm to their lives.\n\nDays passed, and the town's rhythms continued, with Tim relishing his breakfast ritual each day, Becky and her pals exploring the wonders of the earth, and Dina counting down to her wedding, hoping for tranquility amidst the storm. Their lives, though seemingly separate, were interwoven in the fabric of Chester Heights, each thread adding its unique color to the vibrant tapestry of their community.", "eval_result": ["30\n\nThe subplot of Tim and his breakfast routine is somewhat integrated into the main narrative. It contributes to the overall atmosphere of the town and its inhabitants' daily routines.

He was known for his smooth, flawless skin that was as clear as a crystal lake. Until he was about eight years old, that is. His childhood friend, Sam, was an ardent lover of fishing. The two boys would often spend their days together, with Sam trying to teach the more indoor-inclined Cody the art of fishing.\n\nAs their friendship deepened, so did the condition of Cody's skin. As time went on, it began to peel, causing him great discomfort and pain. His once flawless skin became a canvas of red, irritated patches. Sam could only watch helplessly as his friend suffered, their fishing trips becoming less frequent due to Cody's increasing sensitivity to sunlight.\n\nIn the bustling city, Cody's distant relative, Ray, was making a name for himself in the fashion industry. Ray heard about Cody's predicament and decided to help him in the way he knew best. He took a risk and started a new trend altogether - fashionable sun-protective clothing. It was a gamble, but one that paid off tremendously. The trend took off, with people loving the stylish yet functional designs.\n\nMeanwhile, in one of their rare fishing trips, Sam spotted a rare fish. His love for fishing got the best of him, and he dove in after it. Cody, watching from the shore, couldn't help but laugh at Sam's antics. It was a brief moment of normalcy in his otherwise painful life.\n\nRay's successful fashion line allowed him to financially help Cody with his skin condition. With the generous support, Cody was able to visit a renowned dermatologist who then prescribed him special lotions. After diligent use, Cody's skin started to improve. The painful peeling lessened, and his skin began to regain its previous smoothness.\n\nBoth Sam's love for fishing and Ray's fashion enterprise had played a part in Cody's journey. Sam's companionship had given Cody the strength to endure his condition, while Ray's fashion trend had led to his recovery. From then on, Cody's days were filled with more fishing trips and less pain - a testament to the power of friendship and family.", "eval_result": ["80\n\nThe subplot of Sam's love for fishing is well integrated into the main narrative. It serves as a recurring theme and a symbol of the friendship between Sam and Cody. It also provides a sense of normalcy and joy for Cody amidst his struggle with his skin condition. However, it is not indispensable to the main plot, which primarily revolves around Cody's skin condition and his recovery through Ray's help.", "90\n\nThe subplot of Ray's fashion industry success is closely integrated with the main narrative of Cody's skin condition and his friendship with Sam. Ray's decision to create a line of sun-protective clothing is directly influenced by Cody's condition, and the success of this fashion line ultimately provides the financial means for Cody to seek effective treatment. This subplot is not only relevant but also crucial to the resolution of the main plot."]}
