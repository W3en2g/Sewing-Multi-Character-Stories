Lately, he was upset about some things the city council was doing. The decision that infuriated him the most was the council's plan to institute permit parking on his street. Rob believed this would cause unnecessary inconvenience and expense to the residents.\n\nIn the house next to Rob's lived Lisa with her house cat, Ruffles. Ruffles was an adorable feline who had never ventured outside the confines of Lisa's home. He was a true indoor cat, content with lazing by the window and watching the world outside.\n\nRob, fueled by his frustration with the city council, decided to take matters into his own hands. He organized a petition against the permit parking plan. With fervor and determination, he went from door to door, collecting signatures from disgruntled neighbors. His efforts didn't stop there; he also spoke at several city council meetings, articulating his and his neighbors’ concerns with eloquence and grit.\n\nMeanwhile, in Lisa's house, a strange event was unfolding. One day, Ruffles seemed restless, a far cry from his usual calm demeanor. His sparkling eyes were fixed on the door, and it seemed like he wanted to go outside. Lisa, puzzled by this sudden change, left the door ajar. Seizing the opportunity, Ruffles walked out, starting to explore the world beyond the familiar walls.\n\nAs Ruffles was stepping into the unknown, Rob was at the peak of his struggle. He battled in the city council meetings, using every signature he had collected as a weapon. His persistence was relentless, his spirit unbreakable.\n\nBack in the neighborhood, Lisa noticed Ruffles missing and panicked. She dashed out the door, frantically calling out for him. After a nerve-wracking search, she saw a fluffy tail disappearing around a corner. She raced towards it and luckily caught Ruffles in time, saving him from the dangers of the outside world.\n\nAround the same time, Rob was delivering what would be the final blow to the city council's plan. With his well-argued points and the support of his neighbors, he managed to convince the council members. Finally, Rob was able to prevent the measure from being implemented.\n\nAnd so, in their respective battles, both Rob and Lisa emerged victorious. They had managed to protect what was dear to them: Rob, his neighborhood, and Lisa, her beloved cat, Ruffles.", "eval_result": ["60\n\nThe subplot of Lisa and her cat Ruffles is somewhat integrated into the main narrative of Rob's fight against the city council's parking permit plan.

He was hopeful that with a little extra help, he could catch up and improve his grades. Meanwhile, Rob started to take action against the city council's proposed regulation. He organized a petition and went door to door in the neighborhood, collecting numerous signatures from residents who also opposed the measure.\n\nThe tutor that John hired was exceptional. She was patient and knew how to explain the material in a way that John could understand. His grades slowly but surely started to improve. Rob, too, was making progress. He spoke at several city council meetings, voicing his and the community's concerns about the proposed permit parking regulation.\n\nAs the school year progressed, John's grades improved significantly. He was no longer struggling, and his parents were proud of his turnaround. The extra help he received from the tutor had paid off. Around the same time, Rob's efforts against the city council's decision bore fruit.

The need for extra money was pressing, and he had to find a solution. On the other side of town, Lisa, a phenomenal athlete, had no such worries. Her world revolved around her rigorous training for the upcoming Olympics, her mind focused on the gold, much like the one she had won in the previous games.\n\nEugene, after a lot of deliberation, decided to be a dog walker. He loved animals and relished the time he could spend outdoors, away from the confines of an office. His job was simple - he'd go to people's homes while they were at work, leash up their dogs, and set out on long walks until the dogs were sufficiently tired. It was a win-win situation for Eugene. He got the extra money he needed and a chance to be around animals, which he loved.\n\nWhile Eugene was navigating the streets with a pack of dogs, Lisa was at the gym, pushing her body to its limits. She was training for her next big competition, the Olympics. It was hard, grueling, but Lisa was a tenacious fighter. Every day after practice, she'd come home and look at her gold medal. It was a ritual, a reminder of her previous victory and the triumph she longed for again.\n\nEugene loved his new job. He enjoyed the time he spent outdoors, the joyous barks and wagging tails of his canine companions, and the satisfaction of a job well done. Lisa, too, found fulfillment in her routine, her body sore but her spirit soaring with every passing day. She was determined to win another gold medal and would stop at nothing to achieve it.\n\nIn their own ways, Eugene and Lisa were striving, pushing, and working towards their goals. One needed extra money; the other craved another gold medal. Their worlds were different, but their determination was the same.", "eval_result": ["30\n\nThe subplot of Lisa's athletic career and her goal to win another gold medal is not closely integrated with the main narrative of Eugene's financial struggles and his new job as a dog walker. While both characters are striving towards their individual goals, their stories do not intersect or influence each other in any significant way. The subplot and the main plot run parallel to each other, but they do not intertwine or interact."]}

Kelsie's wide eyes sparkled with excitement as she darted from one store to another. Suddenly, she stopped and pointed at a bike displayed in a window. It was a shiny red bike, exactly what Kelsie had been dreaming of. Seeing her daughter's excitement, Tonya agreed to buy it.\n\nBack at Mary's house, she had just started to put shampoo on her hair when she saw a spider. It was a big, dark, and menacing creature, crawling on the edge of the bathtub. As the spider moved, Mary's heart pounded in her chest. She was terrified of spiders. Panic washed over her and she did the only thing she could think of - she ran. Naked and scared, Mary bolted out of the bathtub, leaving a trail of soapy water behind her.\n\nWhile Kelsie was daydreaming about riding her new bike up and down their quiet street, Tonya was at the checkout counter, ready to pay for the bike. She counted her money, her heart sinking as she realized she was ten dollars short. She looked at Kelsie, her excitement still evident, and felt an overwhelming sadness. She couldn't afford the bike.\n\nJust as Tonya was about to tell Kelsie the heartbreaking news, a kind stranger standing in line behind them offered to pay the difference. Overwhelmed by the stranger's generosity, Tonya burst into tears.\n\nAcross town, Mary was still shaking from her frightful encounter, but found a strange comfort in knowing that the only place to go from here was up.

While the two plots occur simultaneously and share a thematic connection of unexpected events and acts of kindness, they do not directly influence or intersect with each other. The subplot provides a contrasting perspective to the main plot but is not indispensable to Mary's storyline."]}

She wished she had managed her disagreement with Max better, preventing it from affecting their trip. She yearned for peace, for the ability to enjoy life without such hurdles.\n\nIn their own corners of the world, both Joel and Lola contemplated their choices. They had let fear and conflict rule their lives, now left with a bitter aftertaste of regret. They longed for change, for a chance to live their lives to the fullest, to seize the day rather than just watch it pass by.", "eval_result": ["70\n\nThe subplot of Lola planning a beach trip and having a fight with her husband is moderately integrated into the main narrative. While Lola's story does not directly interact with Joel's, both characters' experiences contribute to the overarching theme of regret and the desire for change. Lola's subplot adds depth to this theme and provides a parallel to Joel's experience, enhancing the overall narrative. However, the subplot could be removed without drastically altering Joel's story, indicating it is not fully indispensable."]}

As if mirroring his discomfort, the usually calm and serene lake that Sam frequented for his fishing expeditions began to display unprecedented turbulence.\n\nWhile Cody's skin started to peel, causing him immense pain, Sam found solace in his fishing trips on the lake. Despite his friend's suffering, Sam's love for fishing remained undeterred. He would often venture out onto the lake, hoping to catch the biggest fish he could.\n\nOne sunny day, Sam's wish was granted. With a triumphant shout, he reeled in a massive fish, the likes of which had never been seen in Lakefield before. In his excitement, however, he took his eyes off it for just a second, and the fish, taking advantage of his distraction, flopped away!\n\nMeanwhile, Cody's skin condition had worsened to such an extent that he had to seek medical attention.

However, it could exist independently without significantly affecting the main plot, hence the score is not at the maximum."]}
