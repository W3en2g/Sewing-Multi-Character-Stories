The council was planning to implement a measure that would impose a hefty tax on pet ownership. This news had sent a wave of panic through the community, especially among pet owners like Lisa, a sweet elderly lady who lived down the street, and had a house cat named Ruffles.\n\nLisa's love for Ruffles was immeasurable, and the thought of having to give him up due to the impending tax left her feeling helpless and dejected. Ruffles, sensing his owner's distress, had started acting out - darting towards the door every time it opened, in a desperate attempt to escape.\n\nOn the other side of the neighborhood, Mark, a local artist, was oblivious to these happenings. He was engrossed in his work for the upcoming art fair. This year, he was determined to win the grand prize, a hefty cash reward of $10,000. He was working on a piece that symbolized unity and togetherness, the very essence of their community.\n\nMeanwhile, Rob took charge of the situation by organizing a petition against the city council's proposal. He went from door to door, collecting numerous signatures, rallying the community together to fight against the unfair measure. His dedication and determination were infectious, and soon he had the support of almost the entire neighborhood.\n\nOne day, as Rob was approaching Lisa's house to collect her signature, he saw Ruffles dash out the front door. Lisa, in her panic, cried out for help. Rob, without a second thought, sprinted after the feline. Luckily, Lisa had caught Ruffles just in time, with Rob's assistance, preventing him from running into the traffic. This incident further fueled the community's anger against the city council's proposed measure.\n\nThe day of the art fair arrived, and Mark's work was the talk of the town. His piece, depicting a tight-knit community standing against an imposing, faceless entity, resonated deeply with the onlookers, especially his neighbors. The judges were equally impressed, awarding him the grand prize of $10,000!\n\nIn the following week, armed with the community's signatures and the newfound resolve they had found in Mark's artwork, Rob presented their case to the city council. After a long, heated debate, the council finally conceded. Thankfully, Rob was able to prevent the measure from being implemented, thus saving the pet owners of their community from an unjust tax. The neighborhood celebrated their victory, and life returned to its peaceful rhythm, with Lisa and Ruffles enjoying their quiet afternoons and Mark planning his next masterpiece.", "eval_result": ["90\n\nThe subplot of Lisa and her cat Ruffles is closely integrated with the main narrative. The subplot serves as a tangible example of the potential impact of the city council's proposed pet tax, adding emotional weight to the community's opposition. The incident of Ruffles attempting to escape and being caught just in time also directly contributes to the community's anger against the proposed measure, further motivating their fight against it.", "85\n\nThe subplot of Mark entering his work in the art fair and winning $10,000 is well integrated into the main narrative. Mark's artwork, which symbolizes unity and togetherness, becomes a rallying point for the community in their fight against the city council's proposed pet tax. His success at the art fair also provides a moment of celebration for the community amidst their struggle. However, the subplot could be more closely tied to the main narrative if Mark's prize money was used in some way to help the community's cause."]}

His gaze fell on the table where a familiar sight met his eyes — a glossy, shiny postcard lay next to his half-eaten sandwich from dinner. It was an advertisement from the local salon boasting of their latest nail art techniques. Larry's wife, Kelly, had gotten her nails done there just the other day. He recalled the joy in her eyes as she showed off the intricate design — a vibrant mix of colors and sparkles that matched her lively personality. \n\nHowever, that joy had been short-lived.

All thanks to his love for the outdoors and animals, and a little bit of luck.", "eval_result": ["85\n\nThe subplot of Lisa being a phenomenal athlete and her determination to win another competition is well integrated into the main narrative. Lisa's subplot directly impacts Eugene's main plot as her need for someone to take care of her dog, Max, provides Eugene with a job opportunity. This subplot also indirectly contributes to the resolution of the main plot, as Lisa's satisfaction with Eugene's services leads to recommendations, which presumably help Eugene's business grow. However, Lisa's athletic pursuits and competitions are not directly tied to Eugene's personal journey, which slightly reduces the integration score.", "20\n\nThe subplot involving Miranda going to the store and wearing Eugene's shirt is only loosely connected to the main narrative. While Miranda is Eugene's girlfriend, her actions in the subplot do not significantly impact or influence the main storyline, which revolves around Eugene's new job and his relationship with Lisa and her dog, Max. The subplot provides some additional character development for Miranda and her relationship with Eugene, but it could be removed without significantly altering the main narrative."]}

He was known for his frugality and was very stingy with his money. He never took vacations, nor indulged in purchasing even the simplest of luxuries for himself. His retirement was just as his life - minimalistic and without extravagance. This was in stark contrast to his friends, like Lola.\n\nLola, a vivacious woman, was always full of plans and dreams. She was planning to go to the beach with her husband, a getaway they had been looking forward to for a long time. However, destiny had other plans. Due to unforeseen circumstances, they had to cancel their plans. Lola felt very bad that she couldn't realize her dreams. It was not just the beach trip, but many such small plans that had to be put on hold. She envied Joel's contentment with his simple life.\n\nMeanwhile, their mutual friend Donna was dealing with her own set of problems. Her son, a spirited young boy, kept getting into trouble and was suspended from school. This caused her great distress, and she wished he'd take a leaf from Joel's book of discipline. However, as time went on, Donna's son began to change. He started focusing on his studies and took responsibility for his actions. Donna was very relieved at the turnaround her son had made.\n\nIn his later years, after retiring, Joel looked back at his life. He had lived a life of thrift, always counting pennies and never allowing himself to enjoy the fruits of his labor. He felt regretful for never spending more, for not allowing himself the simple pleasures of life. He saw Lola's thwarted plans and Donna's initial distress over her son and realized the importance of living in the moment. The regret was a bitter pill to swallow, but it was also a wake-up call for Joel to start enjoying his life, no matter how late.", "eval_result": ["70\n\nThe subplot of Lola's cancelled beach trip is moderately integrated into the main narrative.

She loved nature, and she often found beauty in the most mundane things. One day, while walking along the road, she started picking up rocks to fill the empty spaces in her backyard garden. The variety of shapes, sizes, and colors fascinated her. She had an idea to impress her pals. She would use these rocks to create a unique piece of art as a wedding gift for her friend Dina, who was getting married in two weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Tim, Becky's younger brother, had his own routine. He woke up early one day, just as the sun was rising. He loved the quiet of the morning, the time when he could be alone with his thoughts. His favorite part of the morning was his breakfast: a bowl of crunchy cornflakes that he'd let soak in the milk a bit before eating. He enjoyed the softened crunch, and despite his mother's pleas to try something else, he stuck to his beloved cereal.\n\nBack to Becky, she had finished collecting the rocks and started crafting her masterpiece. When her pals saw her work, they were amazed. The arrangement of rocks, the thought behind the design, and the effort she put in — everything was impressive. The rocks were no longer just stones; they were memories, feelings, and expressions. Overwhelmed, her pals begged to keep a rock each as a keepsake. Seeing their genuine admiration, Becky couldn't refuse. She let each of them keep a rock, happy that something so simple could mean so much.\n\nAs the days passed, Dina's wedding drew closer. The excitement was building, but so was the nervousness. Dina hoped she wouldn't be so nervous on the actual day of the wedding. She wanted to enjoy every moment, but the fear of things potentially going wrong was always at the back of her mind. But when Becky showed her the rock art, her worries seemed to fade away. It was a reminder of the bond she shared with her friends, a bond that was stronger than any wedding jitters. The rocks, each carrying a piece of their friendship, were indeed the perfect gift.", "eval_result": ["60\n\nThe subplot of Tim's morning routine and his love for cornflakes is somewhat integrated into the main narrative.

It began to peel, causing him severe pain. There were days when even the gentlest touch would make him wince. The once flourishing boy now had to live with the discomfort and insecurities that came with his condition.\n\nWhile Cody was grappling with his skin condition, Sam was battling with his own obsession. He could not get enough of the adrenaline rush that came with fishing. He loved the thrill of the catch, the fighting of the fish, and the eventual triumph of reeling it in. One sunny afternoon, a particularly large fish caught Sam's eye. Without a second thought, he dived into the water after it, risking his life for the thrill of the chase.\n\nAt the same time, their urbanite cousin, Ray, was engrossed in his work in the fashion industry. He was always on the lookout for something unique and interesting to introduce into the world of fashion. His colleagues often found his ideas too risky, but Ray was not one to be dissuaded.

His risk paid off, and his idea sparked a new trend that celebrated diversity and individuality, making him a celebrated figure in the industry.\n\nMeanwhile, Cody's mother, desperate to help her son, sought the help of a renowned dermatologist. After a series of tests, the doctor prescribed special lotions for Cody, promising that they would bring some relief. True to the doctor's words, the lotions worked wonders. Cody's skin started to heal, and he found relief from the constant discomfort.\n\nIn the end, each found their path. Cody's skin improved, allowing him to regain his confidence.
