She trudged back to her room, feeling a bit defeated.\n\nAs the sun began to set, Lagertha finally finished her chores and returned to the kitchen, where she found the roast lamb and candy still waiting for her. But her mother was nowhere to be found, and a note on the table read: \"You're grounded, Lagertha. Go to your room.\" With a sigh, Lagertha obeyed, wondering why her mother was so strict sometimes."}
